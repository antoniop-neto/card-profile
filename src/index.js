      <p>
        After ten years as self-employed, during which I reached the peak of my
        career as a tattoo artist, I decided to seek new challenges and return
        to the programming field, which I studied before and have always been
        interested in, but never professionally pursued. Recently, I completed
        the intensive nine-week bootcamp at Le Wagon school, graduating as a
        Full Stack Web Developer, aiming for ongoing learning and professional
        development. I am excited to work on new projects, contribute, and learn
        from a dynamic team.
